# JupyterHub Developer Guide

## Accessing JupyterHub Environment
For instructions on accessing the KBase JupyterHub environment, please refer to the [KBase JupyterHub User Guide](user_guide.md).

(*If you require `write` access to MinIO and the database catalog, please contact the KBase CDM Tech team.*)

## Accessing MinIO
Please refer to the [MinIO Guide](minio_guide.md) for instructions on accessing MinIO.

### Read/Write MinIO username and password
Get the MinIO username and password with read/write permission from the above JupiterHub environment.
```python
import os
minio_username, minio_password = os.environ['MINIO_ACCESS_KEY'], os.environ['MINIO_SECRET_KEY']
```

### Naming conventions
Please adhere to the following naming conventions for MinIO buckets and objects:

#### Source Files:
Source files are the raw data files that are uploaded to MinIO.
* Bucket name: `namespace_name`-source
* File name: The file name should either clearly represent the table name or be formatted in a way that allows a 
program to easily extract the table name from it.

#### Delta Table Files:
Delta table files are Parquet files generated by Spark during the creation of a table.
* Bucket name: `namespace_name`-delta

## Loading Notebooks
Please create a corresponding loading notebook for each namespace in the `data-loading-notebooks` directory.

Please use the existing loading notebooks as examples.

ðŸš¨ **Please DO NOT rerun the existing loading notebooks in the development environment unless you are certain you 
want to reload the existing table. Instead, create a new notebook for each new namespace and manually verify 
the data loading process.**
