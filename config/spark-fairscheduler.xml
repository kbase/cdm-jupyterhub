<!-- Example configuration file for the Fair Scheduler
https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/conf/fairscheduler.xml.template

Pool configuration supports three properties:
- schedulingMode: FAIR or FIFO
- weight: poolâ€™s share of the cluster relative to other pools
- minShare: minimum share(as a number of CPU cores) of the pool
For more information, see the Fair Scheduler documentation:
